This is my personal bash configuration.  The preferred way to install it would be to symlink .bashrc and .bash_profile to bashrc and bash_profile respectively.  Alternatively, you can try to sync the two files manually but I've found that I struggle to do that and edits are hard to remember to get back into the repo.  _YMMV_.

Running `deploy.bash ~/path/to/bash_configuration` should do the trick.  IMPORTANT: Remember to include the `~` as a prefix to the path to your copy of bash_configuration.  Of course, you will need to start a new shell.
