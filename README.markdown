This is my personal bash configuration.  The preferred way to install it would be to symlink .bashrc and .bash_profile to bashrc and bash_profile respectively.  Alternatively, you can try to sync the two files manually but I've found that I struggle to do that and edits are hard to remember to get back into the repo.  _YMMV_.

Running `deploy.bash` should do the trick.
